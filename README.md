## Description

This GitHub repository is a demonstration of a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application, showcasing the seamless integration of Docker, Jenkins, and Node.js technologies. The project provides a complete DevOps workflow to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, making it easy to maintain and release your Node.js applications efficiently.

## Key Features

- **Dockerized Environment:** The project includes Docker containers to create a consistent and isolated environment for your Node.js application, ensuring that it runs smoothly across different platforms.

- **Jenkins Pipeline:** An elaborative Jenkins pipeline is defined to automate the CI/CD process. It covers stages like code compilation, testing, and deployment to various environments.

- **Node.js Application:** The repository contains a sample Node.js application that serves as the target for CI/CD. You can easily replace it with your own Node.js projects.

- **Testing Framework:** We've integrated a testing framework (e.g., Mocha, Jest) to run tests as part of the CI process, ensuring the quality and reliability of your code.

- **Deployment Strategies:** The project illustrates multiple deployment strategies, including blue-green deployment and rolling deployment, to efficiently release new versions of your application.

- **Infrastructure as Code:** Infrastructure is defined as code using tools like Docker Compose or Kubernetes, making it easy to scale and manage your application in a containerized environment.

## Getting Started
